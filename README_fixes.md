# Database and UI Fixes

## Problem Summary
The Flask application was experiencing the following issues:
1. SQLAlchemy error: "table membership_applications has no column named application_token"
2. UI inconsistencies between Bootstrap 4 and 5 in student templates
3. JavaScript modal initialization issues

## Database Fixes

### 1. Fixing the `membership_applications` Table
Created a script (`fix_db_script.py`) to:
- Check if the `membership_applications` table exists
- Create the table if it didn't exist with all required columns including `application_token`
- Add the `application_token` column if the table existed but was missing the column

The database fix ensures that the SQLAlchemy model and database table structure are in sync.

### 2. Database Verification
Created a verification script (`verify_db.py`) to:
- List all tables in the database
- Show the structure of the `membership_applications` table
- Confirm that the `application_token` column exists

## UI and Template Fixes

### 1. Bootstrap Consistency
Updated the `students/index.html` template to use consistent Bootstrap 5 syntax:
- Changed modal triggers from mixed Bootstrap 4/5 syntax to Bootstrap 5 syntax
- Updated modal close buttons to use the Bootstrap 5 `btn-close` class
- Fixed the layout and spacing classes to follow Bootstrap 5 conventions

### 2. JavaScript Modal Initialization 
Updated the JavaScript code in the `students/index.html` template to:
- Use the Bootstrap 5 modal initialization method (`new bootstrap.Modal()`)
- Properly retrieve modal instances using `bootstrap.Modal.getInstance()`
- Ensure the CSRF token is properly sent with form submissions

### 3. Form Validation
Fixed various form validation issues to ensure data integrity.

## How to Verify the Fixes
1. Run `python fix_db_script.py` to ensure the database table exists with the proper structure
2. Run `python verify_db.py` to confirm the database structure is correct
3. Start the Flask application with `flask run` and test:
   - Creating application links
   - Accessing existing application links
   - Managing student records and their modal interactions

These fixes resolve the core issues that were preventing proper functionality in the membership application process and student management features.
